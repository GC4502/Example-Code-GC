# Genome Assembly

## Description
The task for this project was to analyze FASTQ files in order to assemble a genome for 50 samples of an unknown organism. This analysis included FASTQ quality control, multiple genome assemblers, post-assembly quality control. The best assembled genome was then given to a gene prediction group.
