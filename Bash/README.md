# Bash scripts

## SNP-calling-pipeline.sh

### Description:
A bash script meant to take in two pair-end read files and a reference genome file and outputs the variants of the read files in a .vcf or .vcf.gz file. 

It calls for the use of bcftools, bwa, and the GenomeAnalysisToolKit to complete this task.
